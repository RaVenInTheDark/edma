# Elite Dangerous Modular Assistant
A highly modular and configurable helper tool for Elite Dangerous.



Installation:

 - Download and run [`edma.exe`](https://github.com/RaVenInTheDark/py-elite-helper/releases/tag/0.5-alpha)
 

Usage:

 - You can now run this through a means of your choice. Any event extensions must be in the same directory as the script, more below.
 
 - The config json is in `%appdata%/edinfo/config.json`, if you break something when editing it just delete the file. It may be necassary to create the `edinfo` directory manually.
