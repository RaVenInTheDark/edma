# py-elite-helper
A highly modular and configurable helper tool for Elite Dangerous.



Usage:

 - [Install](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6-amd64.exe) python 3.8

 - Dowload `main.py` 
 
 - In a command prompt window, run `py -3.8 -m pip install game_overlay_sdk==1.0.1 pywin32==228 pygame==2.0.0 keyboard==0.13.5 win32gui==221.6`
 
 - You can now run this using `py -3.8 main.py` while in the same directory as the script. Any event extensions must be in the same directory as the script, more below.
 
 - The config json is in `%appdata%/edinfo/config.json`, if you break something when editing it just delete the file. It may be necassary to create the `edinfo` directory manually.
